                <h1>Soil is dying...</h1>
                <p>62% of India’s soil has less than 0.5% organic content. 52% of the world’s agricultural soil ha already degraded. The United States has lost 50% of its top soil. Loss of
                    organic content in
                    soil turns it into sand. <b>By 2050, 90% of Earth's soil could be degraded.</b></p>

                <h1>We have only 45-60years</h1>
                <p>Every scientific study is clearly pointing out that we have enough soil only for another 80 to 100 crops — 45 to 60 years maximum. <b>In another 30 years’ time, there’s going to be a serious food crisis.</b> That is inevitable, it’s going to happen. At the same time, world population will be over 9 billion.</p>

                <h1> Our awareness can prevent the crisis</h1>
                <p> More than 3.5 billion people (60% of the world’s electorate) stood up for policy redirections to safeguard, nurture and sustain soils. People only need to be aware and display that soil conservation matters to them then the govt. can take important initiatives in that direction with people's support, unless we speak they will never know. Its's a generational responsibility, Save Soil!</p>
